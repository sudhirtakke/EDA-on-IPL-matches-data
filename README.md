This dataset is for IPL cricket matches played in years from 2008 to 2018 and it gives information about different teams, venues and winners. We will try to carry out EDA on this data to find relationship between different columns, patterns between data and which factors contribute to winning  the matches for teams. 
An attempt is made to explore the basic use of Pandas and  cover the basic commands of Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) which includes cleaning, munging, combining, reshaping, slicing, dicing, and transforming data for analysis purpose.
